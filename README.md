# The Annoy-a-tron

The circuit is very straight forward. You just wire:

The positive end of the battery holder to the positive pin on the ATtiny85 (the solder tail).
The negative end of the battery holder to:
The negative pin on the ATtiny85
The negative pin on the piezo speaker
The chosen out pin (I chose pin 1) of the ATtiny85 to the positive end of the piezo speaker.

If you want, you can throw a surface mount switch in there on the negative side of things.
